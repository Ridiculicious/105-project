                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

Now, inside the css folder, style up your page by creating your own CSS file and make it something specific to you. We suggest using the same name that you used for your advice file. Something like emilydavis-styles.css. Again, make sure that the file name you want to use doesn’t already exist on the repo by searching for the file name you want to use on this page.
When you're satisfied with your advice page, add a link to it in the index.html file.
Save and commit your files using the git add and git commit -m commands.
Last but not least, push the code up to your forked GitHub repository using the git push origin your-branch-name command.Go to GitHub and check it out – you should see your changes right there on the screen in front of you! If you don't see 'em, make sure you've got your new branch selected.
Copy the link to your HTML file on your Github repo and upload it below:
